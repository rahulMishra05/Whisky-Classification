1. In this project, we had classify scotch whiskies based on their flavor characterstics.
2. The data set we had used contains the selection of scotch whiskies from serval distillers, and had attempted to cluster whiskies into 
   groups that are simillar in flavor.
3. We will use numpy, panadas and sklearn module for proccessing data and matplotlib.pyplot for giving that data a graphical view

In this repositorie you will get two txt files :
  1. region.txt -> File contain region in which whiskies is produced.
  2. whiskies.txt -> File contain all the other details about whiskies.
  
We had also attached two pdf which has the graphical view of the data we had obtained from the txt files after proccessing.
